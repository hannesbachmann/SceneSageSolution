Programming Challenge: “SceneSage” — LLM-powered Scene Analyzer


Before Starting the application, there are some requirements that need to be installed.
To use an LLM, you need to download Ollama from the official page: 
https://ollama.com/download

After this is done, the preferred LLM can be loaded.
I used one of the smaller versions of the DeepSeek-R1 model with 14B parameters.
This reasoning model from DeepSeek has a strong performance while also 
being free to use via an API. 
To download this model, you first need to open the commandline and type in: 

ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b

This will download the 9.0GB large model.
