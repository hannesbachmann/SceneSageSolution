1
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,759
Greetings, my friend. We are
all interested in the future,

2
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,507
for that is where you and I
are going to spend the
rest of our lives.

3
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:37,365
And remember my friend, future
events such as these will affect
you in the future.

4
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:43,830
You are interested in the
unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.

5
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,072
That is why you are here.
And now, for the first time,

6
00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:54,133
we are bringing to you the full story of what
happened on that fateful day.

7
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:58,678
We are giving you all the evidence, based
only on the secret testimony

8
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:02,416
of the miserable souls who survived

9
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:06,557
this terrifying ordeal. The
incidents, the places,

10
00:01:06,557 --> 00:01:12,617
my friend we cannot keep this a secret any longer.
Let us punish the guilty,

11
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:18,173
let us reward the innocent. My friend,

12
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:23,425
can your heart stand the shocking facts
about grave robbers

13
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:24,435
from outer space?

14
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:49,889
All of us on this earth, know that
there is a time to live,

15
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:54,434
and that there is a time to die,
yet death is always a shock

16
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:57,364
to those left behind.

17
00:02:58,374 --> 00:03:05,444
It is even more of a shock, when death,
the proud brother, comes suddenly without warning.

18
00:03:06,657 --> 00:03:10,293
Just at sundown, a small group,

19
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:13,323
gathered in silent prayer around
the newly-opened grave

20
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:18,475
of the beloved wife of an elderly man.
Sundown of the day,

21
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:22,717
yet also the sundown of the old man's heart,

22
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,272
for the shadows of grief clouded his very reason.

23
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:44,939
The funeral over, the saddened group left the graveside.

24
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:11,908
It was when the gravediggers started their task

25
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:15,949
that strange things began to take place.

26
00:04:19,686 --> 00:04:22,211
Fifteen to four.

27
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:24,130
Yup, right on schedule. There's the
ol' San Fernando Valley

28
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,767
out there now.
-You better radio in

29
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,302
for landing instructions, Danny.
-Right, Jeff.

30
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:35,342
Burbank Tower, this is American
Flight 812, over.

31
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:39,686
Wouldn't surprise
me any if  he's asleep this time of the morning.

32
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:43,928
American Flight 812, this is Burbank Tower.
If I were asleep

33
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:47,968
you'd never get on the ground!
Your case maybe you'd be up there for good. Over.

34
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:53,221
You got me that time, Mac.
This American Flight 812 requesting -

35
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:02,918
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.

36
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:06,958
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.

37
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:11,100
Holy mackeral.
-Burbank Tower to American Flight 812,

38
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,726
are you in trouble?

39
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:18,069
-Trouble ?
-Take a look for yourself.

40
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:23,928
-What in the world...
-That's nothing from this world.

41
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:28,069
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812,
are you in trouble? Are you in trouble?

42
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:32,109
-Mayday, mayday. Stand by, Burbank Tower.
-Do you suppose the passengers saw it?

43
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:36,049
I doubt it. Most of them are asleep.
But it was quite a jolt, Jeff. I'll check.

44
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:39,483
Good. We'll get them ready for landing.
Keep it quiet until we get instructions.

45
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:43,523
-Right.
-American Flight 812 reporting to Burbank Tower, over.

46
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,027
(buzzing noise)

47
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:13,119
-D'you hear anything ?
-I thought I did.

48
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:15,442
Don't like hearin' noises.
'Specially when there ain't s'posed to be any.

49
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:19,079
-Yeah, sorta spooky-like.

50
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,513
-Maybe we're getting' old.
-Whatever it is it's gone now.

51
00:06:22,513 --> 00:06:24,129
-That's the best thing for us too. Gone.

52
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:28,169
-Yeah, let's go.

53
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,234
(The two men scream.)

54
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:05,240
The grief of his wife's death

55
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,280
became greater and greater agony.

56
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:18,270
The home they had so long shared together,
became a tomb.

57
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:23,825
A sweet memory of her joyous living.

58
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:30,492
The sky to which she had once looked,
was now only a covering for her dead body.

59
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:50,997
The ever-beautiful flowers she had
planted with her own hands,

60
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,340
became nothing more than the
lost roses of her cheeks.

61
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:05,239
Confused by his great loss, the old man

62
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:09,279
left that home,
never to return again.

63
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:11,838
(tires screeching; the man cries out in pain)

64
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:17,904
(ambulance horn)

65
00:08:22,815 --> 00:08:26,855
At the funeral of the old man,
unknown to his mourners,

66
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:32,107
his dead wife was watching.

67
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,845
-First his wife, then he.
-Tragic.

68
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:39,279
-Tell me something. Why was his wife buried in the ground,
and

69
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,208
he sealed in a crypt?
-Something to do with family tradition.

70
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,441
A superstition of some sort.

71
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,481
Well, it's getting' dark. Let's be on our way.

72
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:57,546
Then, as two of his mourners left his final resting place…

73
00:08:57,546 --> 00:09:00,363
(screams) Look!

74
00:09:33,521 --> 00:09:36,652
Minutes later, the police, led by Inspector Daniel Clay,

75
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:38,874
arrived at the scene.

76
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:42,107
-Who found him ?
-The man and girl.

77
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:46,147
-Medical, uh, examiner been 'round yet?
-Just left.

78
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:49,379
The morgue wagon oughta be along most any time.
-You get their

79
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,420
statement ?
Yeah, much as we could. They're pretty scared.

80
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,066
-Finding a mess like this oughta make anyone frightened.

81
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:02,409
Have one of the boys take the guy
and the girl back to town. You take charge.

82
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,440
-Okay Inspector. What're you gonna do?

83
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,975
-Look around a little.
-Pretty dark out there.

84
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:12,207
Once you get beyond the range of those lights you won't be
able to see your hand in front of your face.

85
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:15,338
-I will get one of the flashlights from the patrol car.

86
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:19,379
-You be careful Clay.
-I'm a big boy now, Johnny.

87
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:19,277
Looks like a bobcat tore into them.

88
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,297
Yeah.

89
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:26,752
Say Lieutenant,

90
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:30,792
d'you get that funny odour ?
-How could I miss it ?

91
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:34,327
Oh, that'll be the morgue wagon now.

92
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:39,277
-That's the fifth siren in the last hour.
-Oh, something's happened down at

93
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:43,317
the cemetery. A lot of police cars and lights.
I stopped but I didn't see anything.

94
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:48,267
Oh well, whatever it is, the morning paper
will carry the whole story.

95
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:58,166
You seem to still be up there somewhere.

96
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,590
Maybe I am.

97
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:04,630
I don't think I've ever seen you
in this mood before.

98
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:10,388
I guess it's because I've never been
in this mood before.

99
00:12:14,226 --> 00:12:17,256
Something about your flight ?

100
00:12:17,256 --> 00:12:20,186
Yeah.

101
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:24,226
What happened, Jeff ?

102
00:12:29,276 --> 00:12:32,913
-I saw a flying saucer.
-A saucer?

103
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:36,953
You mean the kind from up there?
-Yeah, or its counterpart.

104
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:42,206
It was shaped like a huge cigar.
Dan either saw it too.

105
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:46,246
When it passed over, the whole compartment
lighted up with a blinding glare.

106
00:12:46,347 --> 00:12:49,680
Then there was a tremendous wind that practically
knocked us off our course.

107
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,721
-Well did you report it?
-Yeah, I radioed in immediately and they said well

108
00:12:53,822 --> 00:12:57,862
keep it quiet until you land.
Then as soon as we landed, big army brass grabbed us

109
00:12:58,064 --> 00:13:02,104
and made us swear to
secrecy about the whole thing.

110
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:06,246
Oh, it burns me up. These things have been seen for years.
They're here, it's a fact.

111
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:10,286
And the public oughta know about it.
-There must be something more you can do about it.

112
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:14,326
Oh no there isn't.
Oh, but what's the use of making a fuss.

113
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:19,074
But last night I saw a flying object that
couldn't possibly have been from this planet.

114
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:24,831
But I can't say a word. I'm muzzled by army brass!
I can't even admit I saw the thing!

115
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:28,643
(loud whooshing noise)

116
00:13:45,585 --> 00:13:53,355
(another whooshing noise)

117
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:37,760
(door creaks open)

118
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:31,598
Sounds like Clay's in trouble.

119
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:36,742
(Gun is empty.)

120
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:39,817
(Clay screams and chokes.)

121
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,911
Bet that apparition we saw had
something to do with it.

122
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:43,921
Come on.

123
00:16:07,658 --> 00:16:11,698
-Is he dead ?
-Yeah.

124
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:16,142
He's messed up as bad as those two back there.

125
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,779
S'pose that saucer or whatever it was
had something to do with this?

126
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:22,809
Your guess is as good as mine, Larry.

127
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:26,647
But one thing's sure. Inspector Clay is dead...

128
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:30,688
murdered...and somebody's responsible!

129
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:33,516
You're in charge now, Lieutenant.

130
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:37,556
-Yeah, guess I am. Kelton.
-Yes Sir ?

131
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:41,597
Get back up to the car and get on the radio.
Tell the coroner he's gotta make another trip out here.

132
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,718
Well how 'bout the lab boys ?

133
00:16:43,718 --> 00:16:47,758
Well who do you think we left back at the car,
boy scouts ? Come on, Larry.

134
00:16:54,627 --> 00:17:00,687
Greater love hath no man, than to
lay down his life for another.

135
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:04,324
It is always difficult to have last words

136
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:09,374
over the grave of a friend.
And Inspector Daniel Clay was a friend.

137
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:14,122
A dear friend to me and to all of us.

138
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:18,768
The bell has rung upon his great career.

139
00:17:19,374 --> 00:17:26,445
Now we lay him to rest. A rest well deserved, but so premature.

140
00:17:39,374 --> 00:17:42,808
People turning south from the freeway
were startled when they saw

141
00:17:42,808 --> 00:17:46,848
three flying saucers high over Hollywood Boulevard.

142
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,030
A woman, startled by the sight in the
sky, telephones the police.

143
00:18:28,868 --> 00:18:31,999
There comes a time in each man's life,

144
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:36,040
when he can't even believe his own eyes.

145
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:42,605
Saucers seen over Hollywood!

146
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:48,060
Flying saucers seen over Washington D.C.

147
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:58,060
The army convoy moved into the field.

148
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,605
Rockets were quickly set up.

149
00:19:12,605 --> 00:19:16,342
Colonel Tom Edwards, in charge of saucer field activities,

150
00:19:16,342 --> 00:19:19,575
was to make the greatest decision of his career.

151
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:23,615
He made that decision. Colonel Edwards gave the signal to fire.

152
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:33,210
Then as swiftly as they had come,
they were gone.

153
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,251
Even to the piercing eye of radar and the speeding jet fighters.

154
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:48,867
-Quite a sight, wasn't it Sir.
-A sight I'd rather not be seeing.

155
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:50,887
-Are you worried about them Sir ?

156
00:20:50,887 --> 00:20:52,907
Well, they must have a reason for their visits.

157
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:59,978
Visits? Well that would indicate visitors!
Are big guns the usual way of welcoming visitors?

158
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,220
We haven't always fired at them.

159
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,260
For a time we tried to contact them by radio, but no response.

160
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:14,624
Then they attacked a town. A small town, I'll admit.
But nevertheless a town of people.

161
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:19,068
People who died.
-I never heard about that Sir.

162
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:24,119
Well, it was covered up by the higher echelon. Take any fire,

163
00:21:24,422 --> 00:21:28,058
any earthquake, any major disaster,

164
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:31,088
then wonder.
Flying saucers, Captain,

165
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,816
are still a rumour.

166
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:34,321
Officially.

167
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,381
Looks like we beat them off again Sir.

168
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:44,422
What do they want...where are they from...where are they going...

169
00:21:45,432 --> 00:21:47,856
They, Sir ? Who ?

170
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:52,199
Oh, this is a training maneuver, Sir.
We only did a little practice firing at the clouds.

171
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,543
Yeah. I wonder what their next move will be.

172
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,320
What will their next move be?

173
00:22:19,876 --> 00:22:22,805
Your space commander has returned from Earth.

174
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:23,815
Send him in.

175
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:33,613
You have your report?

176
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:36,542
We had to pull in here to
Space Station 7 for regeneration.

177
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:39,572
We're returning to the planet Earth
immediately thereafter.

178
00:22:40,785 --> 00:22:44,421
-What progress has been made?
-We contacted government officials.

179
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:46,239
They refuse over existence.

180
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:50,279
What plan will you follow now?

181
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,320
Plan 9. It's been absolutely impossible to work through these Earth creatures.

182
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,138
Their soul is too controlled.

183
00:22:58,663 --> 00:23:02,703
Plan 9...ah yes. Plan 9 deals

184
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,330
with the resurrection of the dead.

185
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,370
Long-distance electrodes shot into the pinion
pituitary glands of recent dead.

186
00:23:10,683 --> 00:23:13,713
Have you attempted any of this plan as yet ?
-Yes Excellency.

187
00:23:13,713 --> 00:23:16,239
How successful has it been ?

188
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:20,279
We have risen two so far.
We shall be just as successful on more.

189
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:25,329
The living...they have no suspicion of your movements ?

190
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:27,653
We had to dispose of one policeman.

191
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:32,097
However, none of those risen have been seen.
At least, not by anyone who still remains alive.

192
00:23:32,804 --> 00:23:37,350
It's too bad it must be handled this way. But it must.

193
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,996
Those who we take from the grave will lead the way for our other operations.

194
00:23:41,996 --> 00:23:45,935
Yes, Excellency.
-Continue on. Report to me

195
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:47,955
in two Earth days.

196
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:54,319
I feared His Excellency wouldn't take our report this well.

197
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,652
Well had he been dealing with our own people
his reaction would have been completely different.

198
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,087
He understands the difficulties of the Earth race.

199
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:05,127
What do you think will be the next obstacle
the Earth people will put in our way?

200
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:09,268
Well, as long as they can think we'll have our problems.

201
00:24:10,076 --> 00:24:15,834
But those whom we're using cannot think. They are the dead.
Brought to a simulated life by our electrode guns.

202
00:24:16,844 --> 00:24:22,703
You know, it's an interesting thing when you consider...the Earth people, who can think,

203
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:26,844
are so frightened by those who cannot: the dead.

204
00:24:27,854 --> 00:24:31,894
Well our ship should be regenerated. We better get started.

205
00:25:26,237 --> 00:25:30,278
I still think you oughta go in town and stay with your mother until I get back.

206
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:35,429
This is our home and nothing's going to take me from it.

207
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:39,469
Besides, most men try and keep their wives from going home to Momma.

208
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:43,914
-That's not the point.
-That's all the point there's going to be.

209
00:25:43,914 --> 00:25:47,954
Now toddle off and fly your flying machine, Darling.
But if you see any more

210
00:25:47,954 --> 00:25:52,702
flying saucers, will you tell them to pick another house to buzz?

211
00:25:53,207 --> 00:25:57,045
Be careful. Don't worry about me.

212
00:25:57,045 --> 00:26:01,085
Oh you're the only thing I do worry about. Oh forget about the flying saucers.

213
00:26:01,085 --> 00:26:07,651
They're up there. But there's something in that cemetery,

214
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:10,984
and that's too close for comfort.

215
00:26:10,984 --> 00:26:14,924
The saucers are up there. And the cemetery's out there.

216
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:21,590
But I'll be locked up in there. Now off to your wild blue yonders.

217
00:26:22,095 --> 00:26:24,014
You promise you'll lock the doors immediately ?

218
00:26:24,014 --> 00:26:28,055
I promise. Besides, I'll be in bed before half an hour is gone,

219
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:31,388
with your pillow beside me.
-My pillow ?

220
00:26:31,388 --> 00:26:35,428
Well, I have to have something to keep me company while you're away.

221
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:44,620
Sometimes in the night when it does get a little lonely,
I reach over and touch it, then it doesn't seem so lonely anymore.

222
00:26:47,448 --> 00:26:48,863
A crazy kid.

223
00:26:57,852 --> 00:27:00,883
Well I do love you, Darlin'.

224
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:18,256
See you Thursday.
-Goodbye, Honey.

225
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:24,216
You know I'm not leaving here until you're locked safely inside.

226
00:27:24,216 --> 00:27:28,256
All right, Darling.

227
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:41,791
If you're especially nice I may even lock the side door.

228
00:27:42,296 --> 00:27:46,337
And be sure you keep the yard lights on.

229
00:28:07,447 --> 00:28:10,882
You're mighty silent this trip, Jeff.

230
00:28:10,882 --> 00:28:12,902
You haven't spoken ten words since takeoff.

231
00:28:12,902 --> 00:28:16,134
I guess I'm preoccupied, Danny.

232
00:28:16,134 --> 00:28:19,266
We've got thirty-three passengers back there that have time to be preoccupied.

233
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:22,801
Flying this flybird doesn't give you that opportunity.

234
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,932
I guess you're right, Danny.

235
00:28:25,932 --> 00:28:29,164
-Paula ?
-Yeah.

236
00:28:29,164 --> 00:28:32,397
-There's nothing wrong between you two ?
-Oh no, nothing like that.

237
00:28:32,397 --> 00:28:36,033
Just that I'm worried, she being there alone and those strange things flying over the house and

238
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:40,435
those incidents in the graveyard these past few days. It's just got me worried.

239
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:45,629
Well, maybe they haven't figured out those crazy skybirds yet, but
I give you 50:1 odds

240
00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:48,053
the police have figured out that cemetery thing by now.

241
00:28:48,053 --> 00:28:51,386
-I hope so.
-If you're really that worried Jeff why don't you radio in and find out?

242
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:56,437
Mac should be on duty at the field by now.
He could call Paula and relay the message to you.

243
00:28:57,245 --> 00:29:01,285
-Hi Edith.
-Hi Silents. I haven't heard a word from this end of the plane since we left the field.

244
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:04,922
Jeff's been giving me and himself a study in silence.

245
00:29:04,922 --> 00:29:08,154
-You boys aren't feudin'?
-Oh no Edie, nothing like that.

246
00:29:08,154 --> 00:29:10,881
Hey Edie, how about you and me balling it up in Albuquerque ?

247
00:29:10,881 --> 00:29:14,517
Albuquerque ? Have you read that flight schedule Boy ?
-What about it ?

248
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:18,558
We land in Albuquerque at 4 am. That's strictly a nine o'clock town.

249
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,083
Well I know a friend that'll help us --

250
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:24,517
-Let's have a problem first, huh Danny?
-Ah he's worried about Paula.

251
00:29:24,517 --> 00:29:29,534
I read about that cemetery business.
I tried to get you kids not to buy too near one of those things.

252
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,598
We'll get there soon enough as it is!

253
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:34,315
He thought it'd be quiet and peaceful there.

254
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:37,749
No doubt about that.
It's quiet alright, like a tomb.

255
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:41,285
I'm sorry Jeff, that was a bad joke.

256
00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:44,820
Say, I almost forgot what I came in here for.
How's the coffee situation?

257
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,951
-Mmmm that's for me.
-That sure wouldn't hurt anything, Edie.

258
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:51,992
Okay, I'll be right back. And say Jeff, make that call to Mac.

259
00:29:52,497 --> 00:29:56,537
Huh, not only will she throw water on my Albuquerque plan but now she's
repeating herself.

260
00:29:56,739 --> 00:30:00,780
-How 'bout that Albuquerque ball?
-I can't resist your charm, Danny Boy.

261
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:12,093
Residents near the cemetery paid little attention to the blast of thunder

262
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:14,921
and the flash of lightning.

263
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:19,769
But from the blast, arose the moving figure of the dead old man.

264
00:30:35,873 --> 00:30:42,155
(telephone rings)

265
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:52,496
Hello? Who?

266
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:56,637
Mac? Well, hi Mac!

267
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:59,062
Sure I'm all right.

268
00:30:59,062 --> 00:31:01,082
I just fell asleep.

269
00:31:03,304 --> 00:31:06,738
Tell Jeff I'm all right.

270
00:31:06,738 --> 00:31:10,779
Okay Mac. Thanks for calling. Goodnight.

271
00:31:47,931 --> 00:31:49,532
(she screams)

272
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,197
(she screams)

273
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:40,473
Mrs. Trent! Mrs. Trent! What's wrong?

274
00:35:51,808 --> 00:35:57,999
(police siren)

275
00:36:55,926 --> 00:36:59,967
They'll be at the hatch in a moment.
You can open it now, Tanna.

276
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,320
Turn off the electrodes quickly.
They can't tell us from anyone else.

277
00:37:50,774 --> 00:37:53,400
It's tough to find something when you don't know what you're looking for.

278
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,441
-I don't think the Lieutenant does either.
-Then what're doing out here? I was off duty an hour ago.

279
00:37:57,845 --> 00:38:01,885
Ah don't ask me any questions. I'm just a hard hat just like you.

280
00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:11,986
What do you suppose that noise was?

281
00:38:11,986 --> 00:38:15,925
Whatever it was it's no more strange than the other things happening around this cemetery.

282
00:38:15,925 --> 00:38:19,360
Spirits like Old Farmer Caulder talked about.

283
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,400
-Heh. Maybe.
-The only spirits he saw tonight were those I smelled on his breath.

284
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:27,440
Well don't forget Mrs. Trent claims to have seen them too.
She didn't have anything on her breath.

285
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,481
-She was hysterical.
-Well true, she was frightened, and in a state of shock.

286
00:38:31,986 --> 00:38:36,026
But, don't forget that torn nightgown and the scratched feet.

287
00:38:37,137 --> 00:38:43,602
Yeah I hadn't thought of that.
I guess that's why you're a detective lieutenant

288
00:38:43,703 --> 00:38:46,329
and I'm still a uniformed cop.

289
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:48,753
Sometimes it's only the breaks, Larry. In the meantime let's get-

290
00:38:48,753 --> 00:38:51,683
-Lieutenant, Lieutenant! Did you hear that?
-How could we help it?

291
00:38:51,683 --> 00:38:53,602
-It sure was strange.
-Know what it was?

292
00:38:53,602 --> 00:38:57,036
-No more than you do.
-If it weren't for orders I'd get out of here right now.

293
00:38:57,036 --> 00:38:59,460
-It was a saucer.
-A flying saucer? What makes you say that?

294
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,086
You remember the noise we heard the other night?

295
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:04,612
We were knocked to the ground, how could I forget?

296
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:08,450
Exactly, but you're not remembering that sound.

297
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:13,500
There you're wrong, Lieutenant.
I'm with the fact the sound is similar, but what about the blinding light?

298
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:18,248
Well haven't you heard?
Many times a saucer hasn't had a glow,

299
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:22,793
or a light of any kind for that matter.
-That proves it. What next Lieutenant?

300
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:29,561
Oh, Lieutenant! Maybe this doesn't mean much,
but uh Jamie and me found a grave that looks like it's been busted into.

301
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:31,177
-What? Where?
-Why uh why...

302
00:39:31,177 --> 00:39:34,712
-Come on man out with it, we haven't got all day to waste.

303
00:39:34,712 --> 00:39:38,753
-Uh, just over there beyond the crypt.
-All right, show us the way!

304
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:44,712
Look, here it is Lieutenant.

305
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,965
Yeah, it's been broken into all right.

306
00:39:49,965 --> 00:39:54,005
Strange. If someone had broken in, the dirt should be piled up here somewhere.

307
00:39:55,419 --> 00:39:59,965
It looks like it's fallen into the grave.
-Larry you'll be out of that uniform before you know it.

308
00:40:01,177 --> 00:40:05,217
-Do we have the right to look down there Lieutenant ?
-Ah, technically no.

309
00:40:05,217 --> 00:40:11,076
Well, this spot looks familiar, though.
We shouldn't investigate any further without the permission of  next to kin.

310
00:40:11,581 --> 00:40:12,894
Let's go get it!

311
00:40:12,894 --> 00:40:16,934
-How?
-I see what you mean, the gravestone's down there.

312
00:40:17,237 --> 00:40:19,762
Well, let's go down and find out whose grave it is.

313
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:23,601
-How?
-By going down and finding out!

314
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:27,641
-Are you sure you mean that Lieutenant?
-If I didn't mean it I wouldn't have said it.

315
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:31,782
-Scared?
-Well, why do I always get hooked up with these spook details?

316
00:40:32,287 --> 00:40:35,823
Monsters, graves, bodies,...

317
00:40:35,823 --> 00:40:36,833
oooh all right.

318
00:40:45,924 --> 00:40:49,661
Casket's here, but nobody's in it.

319
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:53,499
Can you read the name on the casket?

320
00:40:53,499 --> 00:40:56,833
It's too dark. Give me a flashlight.

321
00:40:56,833 --> 00:41:00,873
-How 'bout a match?
-We sure could try it. Let me have them!

322
00:41:11,075 --> 00:41:15,115
It's Inspector Clay's grave!
Be he ain't in it!

323
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:25,115
But meanwhile, at the Pentagon, in Washington, D.C.…

324
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:34,812
Right G2...

325
00:41:34,812 --> 00:41:37,438
Come in !

326
00:41:37,438 --> 00:41:41,479
Yes of course, I'll keep in touch.

327
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:48,953
Come in, Colonel Edwards. Close the door. At ease, Colonel.

328
00:41:48,953 --> 00:41:52,691
-Thank you, Sir.
-Sit down.

329
00:41:55,721 --> 00:42:00,266
I understand, Colonel, you've been on tap for many of our saucer attacks.

330
00:42:01,276 --> 00:42:04,913
I'm in charge of field operations, Sir.

331
00:42:04,913 --> 00:42:08,953
You believe there are such things as flying saucers, Colonel ?

332
00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:11,478
-Yessir.
-You've seen them ?

333
00:42:11,478 --> 00:42:13,296
Yessir.

334
00:42:13,296 --> 00:42:17,943
You realize there's a government directive
stating that there is no such thing as a flying saucer?

335
00:42:19,357 --> 00:42:20,973
Yessir.

336
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:24,306
You stand by your statement that you've seen flying saucers?

337
00:42:24,306 --> 00:42:27,741
Well, uh...

338
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:30,569
yessir.

339
00:42:30,569 --> 00:42:34,609
This could mean a court martial. Admitting this against direct orders.

340
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,155
General Roberts, may I speak freely?

341
00:42:39,155 --> 00:42:42,185
-You may.
How could I hope to hold down my command

342
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:46,225
if I didn't believe in what I saw and shot at?

343
00:42:48,245 --> 00:42:52,286
-I, uh, like you Colonel.
-Thank you, Sir.

344
00:42:53,094 --> 00:42:57,134
There are flying saucers.

345
00:42:58,447 --> 00:43:02,488
There's no doubt they are in our skies.
They've been there for some time.

346
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,215
What're we going to do about them?

347
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:08,952
-Who knows?
-Then, uh, they really are there?

348
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:12,993
-I thought you were convinced of that!
-I am.

349
00:43:13,195 --> 00:43:15,417
We've had contact with them.

350
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:18,346
-Contact? How?
-Radio.

351
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:21,477
-They speak our language?
-Well not quite.

352
00:43:21,477 --> 00:43:26,831
We  received messages from their space ships.
For a while it came in as just a lot of jumbled noise.

353
00:43:27,942 --> 00:43:29,760
And now, Sir?

354
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,710
Well since they first uh tried contact with us by radio,
we've developed a language computer.

355
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,659
A machine that breaks down any language to our own.

356
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:43,699
General, uh,  what's this all got to do with me?

357
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:48,245
Well you've been in charge of saucer field activity for a long while.

358
00:43:48,245 --> 00:43:52,184
I think it's about time you heard these recordings. Do you mind?

359
00:43:52,184 --> 00:43:56,225
Mind? Huh, I'm anxious!

360
00:44:02,487 --> 00:44:06,527
This is Eros, a space soldier from a planet of your galaxy.

361
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:12,891
I fully realize our language differences,
however I also know you finally have

362
00:44:12,992 --> 00:44:21,073
perfected the dictorobitary, or as you on Earth put it,
the language computer. So you can now understand that which I speak.

363
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:26,325
Since the beginning of your time, we have been far beyond your planet.

364
00:44:26,527 --> 00:44:32,689
It has taken you centuries to even grasp what we developed eons of your years ago.

365
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:40,163
Do you still believe it impossible we exist?
You didn't actually think you were the only inhabited planet in the universe?

366
00:44:41,173 --> 00:44:43,901
How can any race be so stupid?

367
00:44:43,901 --> 00:44:49,759
Permit me to set your mind at ease.
We do not want to conquer your planet. Only save it.

368
00:44:50,769 --> 00:44:54,810
We could have destroyed it long ago, if that had been our aim.

369
00:44:55,921 --> 00:45:01,476
Our principal purpose is friendly.
I admit, we have had to take certain means which you might

370
00:45:01,476 --> 00:45:03,698
refer to as criminal,

371
00:45:03,698 --> 00:45:07,739
but that is because of your big guns
which have destroyed some of our representatives.

372
00:45:08,547 --> 00:45:15,618
If you persist in denying us our landings,
then we must only accept that you do not want us on friendly terms.

373
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:22,183
We then have no alternative but to destroy you before you destroy us.

374
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:30,971
With your ancient, juvenile minds, you have developed explosives too fast for your minds to conceive what you were doing.

375
00:45:31,274 --> 00:45:35,314
You are on the verge of destroying the entire universe.

376
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:37,637
We are part of that universe.

377
00:45:37,637 --> 00:45:38,648
This is our last -

378
00:45:44,203 --> 00:45:49,254
That's the end of that one.
Atmospheric conditions in outer space often interfere with transmitting.

379
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:52,486
How many of these recordings do you have General?

380
00:45:52,486 --> 00:45:56,526
An even dozen up to now. This was the last one.
We received it over a month ago.

381
00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:00,870
-Do you think they mean business?
-We can't afford to take any chances.

382
00:46:00,456 --> 00:46:06,728
Come over here. You ever been to Hollywood?

383
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:10,768
-Oh a couple of times. A few years ago.
-You're going to be there in the morning.

384
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:16,829
Just a few minutes from Hollywood, in the town of San Fernando, reports have come in

385
00:46:16,829 --> 00:46:20,869
of saucers flying so low the exhaust  knocked people to the ground.

386
00:46:21,677 --> 00:46:25,718
There have even been stated claims of saucer landings.

387
00:46:26,223 --> 00:46:29,960
Major Carlson will replace you while you're out there.

388
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,293
You're the best man for the job of attempting to contact them.

389
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:37,132
Find them, Colonel. See what in hell it is they want!

390
00:46:37,132 --> 00:46:38,142
All right, Sir.

391
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:47,738
These are confidential reports, Colonel.
Read them over carefully on the plane,

392
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:52,788
turn them over to intelligence when you get to Los Angeles.
They'll have further orders for disposition.

393
00:46:53,596 --> 00:46:54,606
Yessir.

394
00:46:57,132 --> 00:46:59,859
-Colonel Edwards?
-Yessir?

395
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:00,869
-Good luck.
-Thank you, Sir.

396
00:47:31,273 --> 00:47:33,192
We are ready to report, Excellency.

397
00:47:33,192 --> 00:47:37,232
-You are many days late.
-It was unavoidable.

398
00:47:37,232 --> 00:47:41,272
We tried to transmit via televisor, but atmospheric
conditions made transmission impossible.

399
00:47:42,283 --> 00:47:46,323
-You should have transmitted as soon as conditions permitted.
-I thought time was of the essence.

400
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:51,171
Suspicion  has fallen upon our movements.
Our ships have been viewed near the point of operations.

401
00:47:52,282 --> 00:47:55,414
And what has this added time gained, Eros?

402
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:59,454
We have successfully risen three of the dead ones.

403
00:47:59,454 --> 00:48:02,585
-Permit me to see one.
-Bring in the big one.

404
00:48:02,585 --> 00:48:06,626
Use your small electrode gun.

405
00:48:09,555 --> 00:48:11,878
I have taken two ships from your command.

406
00:48:11,878 --> 00:48:15,413
But...that will leave only my ship!

407
00:48:15,413 --> 00:48:19,454
It is necessary that you continue your mission alone.

408
00:48:19,454 --> 00:48:23,393
I have need of your other ships elsewhere.

409
00:48:23,393 --> 00:48:28,444
Even though you have risen three of the Earth dead,
the plan is far from successful,

410
00:48:29,757 --> 00:48:33,797
and you Eros, must prove it an operational success before
more time,

411
00:48:33,898 --> 00:48:38,848
energy, ships, and your countrymen may be spent on it.

412
00:48:40,363 --> 00:48:43,191
We will not fail. Everything is on our side.

413
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:47,534
Not everything!
You do not have the live Earth people!

414
00:48:52,686 --> 00:48:57,029
You reported that your ship was viewed at the scene of your present operations?

415
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,443
That is correct.

416
00:48:59,453 --> 00:49:03,494
They have been viewed many times, but not at the scene of operations.

417
00:49:03,797 --> 00:49:04,807
Something must be done about that.

418
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:17,130
Stop him Tanna! He's close enough! Turn off your electrode gun!

419
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:21,372
No! No! Stop him Tanna!

420
00:49:22,281 --> 00:49:24,908
I can't get it, it's jammed!
-Stop him you fool!

421
00:49:24,908 --> 00:49:28,948
Drop the gun to the floor, Tanna!
The metal will break contact!

422
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,039
[Gasping] That was too close!

423
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:39,049
Yes.

424
00:49:43,796 --> 00:49:46,827
Bring the giant here that I may get a better look at him.

425
00:50:00,261 --> 00:50:04,806
Yes, he's a fine specimen.
Are they all this powerful on planet Earth?

426
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,038
This one is an exception, Excellency.

427
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:12,079
-What are the other two like?
-One is a woman, the other an old man.

428
00:50:12,887 --> 00:50:16,119
-An old man, you say?
-Yes, Excellency.

429
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:23,897
This gives me a plan. Put the big one away.

430
00:50:23,897 --> 00:50:27,937
Pick up your electrode gun.
Make sure it's in working order before pointing it at him.

431
00:50:28,846 --> 00:50:31,170
Whatever made it jam must have been cleared by the fall.

432
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,382
Take him back to the ship.

433
00:50:44,503 --> 00:50:52,886
The old one must be sacrificed. Re-land on Earth.
Send the old one to enter a dwelling.

434
00:50:54,099 --> 00:50:58,139
Then cut the electrokinetic and turn on your ship's decomposure ray.

435
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:08,341
The result will astound those watching. Astound them enough to delay their intention until you have gained your other recruits from the cemetery.

436
00:51:09,452 --> 00:51:12,785
Yes, Excellency. It'll be done.

437
00:51:12,785 --> 00:51:15,040
Report to me when this has been accomplished.

438
00:51:23,189 --> 00:51:27,229
Eros, the Earth people are getting closer to that which we fear.

439
00:51:27,431 --> 00:51:31,169
Since they will not listen or respect our existence,

440
00:51:31,169 --> 00:51:35,209
they cannot help but believe our powers when they see their own dead walking 'round again,

441
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:40,563
brought about by our advancement in such things. As soon as you have enough of the dead recruits,

442
00:51:41,068 --> 00:51:50,158
march them on the capitals of the Earth, let nothing stand in your way. Their own dead will be used to make them accept our existence, and believe in that fact.

443
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:10,597
(police siren)

444
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:37,734
Mr. and Mrs. Trent...this is Colonel Edwards from Washington, D.C.

445
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:40,158
-Good evening, Colonel.
-Hello Colonel.

446
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:42,380
Colonel would like to ask you a few questions.

447
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:46,420
-Questions? What about, Colonel?
-May I, uh, sit down?

448
00:52:47,128 --> 00:52:49,350
Oh, I'm sorry, please do.

449
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:53,390
I want to ask you about your strange experience the other night, when you saw the flying saucer.

450
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:00,663
After that the police brought me home.

451
00:53:00,663 --> 00:53:04,097
I hope I never see such a sight again.

452
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:07,531
Well after your description I don't think I'd want to see it either.

453
00:53:07,531 --> 00:53:11,572
One thing
more...after you were forced to the ground by that blast of wind,

454
00:53:11,774 --> 00:53:17,430
was it a hot or cold blast?
-It's kind of hard to explain.

455
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:23,592
It wasn't hot, wasn't cold, it was just a terrific force. We-we couldn't get off the ground.

456
00:53:23,895 --> 00:53:27,935
The light blinded me so badly I couldn't see a thing.

457
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:33,491
We could only feel the pressure of the wind, until it was gone.
When the glare left us,

458
00:53:33,895 --> 00:53:36,925
we could see a glowing ball disappearing off in the distance.

459
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:38,541
-Which way?
-Toward the cemetery.

460
00:53:55,511 --> 00:53:59,147
This is the most fantastic story I've ever heard.

461
00:53:59,147 --> 00:54:01,066
And every word of it's true, too.

462
00:54:01,066 --> 00:54:03,490
That's the fantastic part of it.

463
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:07,531
Colonel, we found a lot of suspicious things out in that cemetery.

464
00:54:07,834 --> 00:54:11,874
Then again, didn't find anything to base a fact or suspicion on.

465
00:54:13,389 --> 00:54:17,430
Hey, do you hear anything?

466
00:54:23,389 --> 00:54:25,914
You see anything out there Kelton?

467
00:54:25,914 --> 00:54:29,753
Too dark, Lieutenant.

468
00:54:29,753 --> 00:54:33,793
But something's started stinking awful bad.

469
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:44,399
There's something out there.

470
00:56:12,479 --> 00:56:16,721
-What do you make of that?
-You got me! It didn't look that way a minute ago.

471
00:56:18,236 --> 00:56:21,267
-What about your man?
-Oh, in the excitement I forgot all about Kelton.

472
00:56:29,448 --> 00:56:30,862
Oh, he'll be all right in a few minutes.

473
00:56:33,691 --> 00:56:36,822
-Did you see that thing? Did you get it?
-We've got it.

474
00:56:36,822 --> 00:56:40,761
What was it? It didn't fall...I fired every bullet I had.

475
00:56:40,761 --> 00:56:46,317
So did I. I don't know what it was or what happened, but unless that bag of bones

476
00:56:46,418 --> 00:56:49,953
can reassemble itself, it's out of the running now.

477
00:57:01,266 --> 00:57:04,902
Colonel I've been out here so often you'd think I'd taken a lease on this place.

478
00:57:04,902 --> 00:57:06,923
Not a long lease, I hope.

479
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:10,963
I see what you mean. But you know, I can't help but feel the answer's out here
somewhere.

480
00:57:12,074 --> 00:57:13,993
Is the uh girl safe?

481
00:57:15,003 --> 00:57:19,347
Mrs. Trent you'd better stay with the car.
-Stay here alone? Not on your life.

482
00:57:20,963 --> 00:57:24,094
-Modern women...
-Yeah, they been that way all down through the ages.

483
00:57:24,094 --> 00:57:26,821
Especially in a spot like this.

484
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:28,943
-Kelton! -Yessir?
-Stay with Mrs. Trent.

485
00:57:28,943 --> 00:57:29,953
All right, Lieutenant.

486
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,690
-Now you stay close to the officer, Honey.
-I'd feel safer with you.

487
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:43,387
-Now the Lieutenant knows best.
-Oh I don't like it, but I guess there isn't much I can do about it.

488
00:57:51,164 --> 00:57:53,690
-You have a gun?
-No.

489
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:54,700
Know how to use one?

490
00:57:56,114 --> 00:57:57,730
After four years in the Marine Corps?

491
00:57:58,756 --> 00:58:02,578
-Here.
-You think we'll need these?

492
00:58:02,578 --> 00:58:04,397
You can never tell. Let's get going.

493
00:58:26,114 --> 00:58:29,447
-What do you expect to find out here?
-Well there's only one answer to that Mr. Trent,

494
00:58:29,447 --> 00:58:33,891
we'll know when we find it. Inspector Clay's grave is right over here.

495
00:58:34,497 --> 00:58:37,730
-Is that the one you told me was broken into?
-Yes.

496
00:58:55,709 --> 00:58:57,426
-This it?
-Yeah.

497
00:58:57,426 --> 00:59:00,154
Looks to me like someone had broken out instead of in.

498
00:59:00,154 --> 00:59:07,123
-I figured that, but that's impossible! -I wonder.
-Look, Colonel, some things just can't happen.

499
00:59:07,224 --> 00:59:13,891
Yeah well after that apparition that was draped across Mr. Trent's patio, I would say we should keep our minds open to anything.

500
00:59:13,992 --> 00:59:18,032
Look, Colonel, I'm a policeman. I've got to deal in facts.

501
00:59:18,032 --> 00:59:25,709
But, I guess I'll have to go along with you.  You know I bet my badge right now we haven't seen the last of those weirdies.

502
00:59:31,163 --> 00:59:34,699
-They'll discover our ship soon.
-You're going to let them find us?

503
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:38,739
It's the only way. These are the same men who have been so close so often.

504
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:42,072
They must be halted before they can inform others about us.

505
00:59:42,072 --> 00:59:44,092
-But there were others in the car!
-They'll be taken too.

506
00:59:48,436 --> 00:59:52,476
Send the big one for the girl and the policeman. I'll turn on the dictorobitary so we may converse with them.

507
01:00:25,102 --> 01:00:27,930
You know, maybe we're barking up the wrong tree.

508
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:30,961
One thing a policeman learns, Mr. Trent, is patience.

509
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:35,001
-Where's that burn spot you mentioned?
-Right over the - look!

510
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:46,819
We'll investigate, but move carefully.

511
01:01:09,433 --> 01:01:11,454
(screams)

512
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:22,270
(woman screams)

513
01:01:32,677 --> 01:01:37,526
A moment or two more, and you will be the first live Earth people

514
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:39,748
ever to enter a celestial ship.

515
01:01:41,162 --> 01:01:45,202
Wow...boy,  how could anything that big hide for so long a time?

516
01:01:47,727 --> 01:01:50,556
Never heard metal sound like that before.

517
01:01:50,556 --> 01:01:54,596
-What do you see?
-Only my reflection. Must be some kind of one-way glass.

518
01:01:55,303 --> 01:01:59,343
-I wonder how you get into this thing.
-I'm not sure I want to find out.

519
01:02:12,071 --> 01:02:13,081
They're just outside.

520
01:02:19,343 --> 01:02:20,656
You can open the outer hatch now.

521
01:02:33,822 --> 01:02:34,869
Look out!

522
01:02:37,626 --> 01:02:40,757
-You goin' in that thing?
-That's what we're here for.

523
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:45,808
-I don't know, the way these things speed around we might just get in there and pft! Off it goes.
-That's a chance we take.

524
01:02:47,424 --> 01:02:52,878
Well, I took a chance on those earlier airplanes. Might just as well see what the inside of one of these looks like. Got your guns ready ?

525
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:58,939
-I tell you one thing, if a little green man pops out at me I'm shooting first and asking questions later.

526
01:03:08,232 --> 01:03:09,747
They're in the outer chamber now.

527
01:03:11,767 --> 01:03:15,807
Eros, do we have to kill them?

528
01:03:17,221 --> 01:03:21,262
-Yes.
-It seems such a waste.

529
01:03:21,868 --> 01:03:26,918
Well wouldn't it be better to kill a few now than, with their meddling, permit
them  to destroy the entire universe?

530
01:03:29,544 --> 01:03:32,272
-You're always right, Eros.
-Of course.

531
01:03:32,272 --> 01:03:36,312
But those are not my words, those are the words of the Ruler.

532
01:03:43,181 --> 01:03:44,191
Now you two stay right where you're at.

533
01:03:50,251 --> 01:03:57,322
We will do as you command. For the moment.
-No for the moment about it. You just do as I tell you.

534
01:04:05,201 --> 01:04:09,140
You do not need guns.
-Maybe we think we do.

535
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:13,483
They would be of no use to you now.
-They've been mighty useful before on flesh and blood,

536
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:17,322
and you two look like you've got a lot of both.

537
01:04:19,847 --> 01:04:24,897
True, they would be effective upon us. If you were to have the opportunity to use them...

538
01:04:25,402 --> 01:04:30,251
Mister, if you don't get away from that control board I'll show you just how
effective they can be.

539
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:38,332
Shall we talk now, or wait? Your friends will be here shortly.

540
01:04:38,534 --> 01:04:41,968
-What friends?
-Those you left at the vehicle.

541
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:46,008
-If you've done anything to Paula...
-Take it easy Mr. Trent.

542
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:50,049
Oh I assure you, no harm has come to her. Would you like to see?

543
01:04:52,574 --> 01:04:56,614
Next time you try that I won't aim at the board.
-You're a headstrong young man.

544
01:04:56,917 --> 01:05:00,250
I was only going to turn on the televisor so you could see her movements.

545
01:05:03,988 --> 01:05:08,028
Go ahead, my friend, but move very carefully.

546
01:05:22,674 --> 01:05:24,392
She's only fainted.

547
01:05:25,402 --> 01:05:29,240
-You fiend!
-I? A fiend? ...

548
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:32,977
I am a soldier of our planet!

549
01:05:34,695 --> 01:05:40,553
I? A fiend? We did not come here as enemies.

550
01:05:41,462 --> 01:05:45,401
We came only with friendly intentions. To talk.

551
01:05:45,401 --> 01:05:47,018
To ask your aid.

552
01:05:47,018 --> 01:05:49,644
-Our aid?
-Yes.

553
01:05:49,644 --> 01:05:56,108
Your aid for the whole universe. But your governments of Earth refused even to accept our existence.

554
01:05:56,512 --> 01:06:02,573
Even though you've seen us, heard our messages, you still refused to accept us.

555
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,219
Why is it so important that you want to contact the governments of our Earth?

556
01:06:07,219 --> 01:06:11,462
Because of death. Because all you of Earth are idiots!

557
01:06:12,977 --> 01:06:16,613
-Now you just hold on, Buster.
-No you hold on.

558
01:06:16,613 --> 01:06:21,361
First was your firecracker, a harmless explosive. Then your handgrenade.

559
01:06:22,068 --> 01:06:29,138
They began to kill your own people a few at a time. Then the bomb, then a larger bomb.

560
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:34,088
Many people are killed at one time. Then your scientists

561
01:06:34,189 --> 01:06:38,229
stumbled upon the atom bomb. Split the atom.

562
01:06:38,633 --> 01:06:42,674
Then the hydrogen bomb, where you actually explode the air itself.

563
01:06:44,391 --> 01:06:49,441
Now you [audio jump] brings the destruction of the entire universe, served by our sun.

564
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:55,401
The only explosion left is the solaronite.

565
01:06:56,108 --> 01:06:59,441
-Why there's no such thing.
-Perhaps to you.

566
01:06:59,441 --> 01:07:04,491
But we've known it for centuries. Your scientists will stumble upon it as they have all the others.

567
01:07:05,906 --> 01:07:11,966
But the juvenile minds which you possess will not comprehend its strength until it's too late.

568
01:07:12,774 --> 01:07:15,804
You're way above our heads.

569
01:07:15,804 --> 01:07:19,845
The solaronite is a way to explode the actual particles of sunlight.

570
01:07:20,451 --> 01:07:22,774
Why that's impossible.

571
01:07:22,774 --> 01:07:26,814
Even now, your scientists are working on a way to harness the sun's rays.

572
01:07:27,219 --> 01:07:30,148
The rays of sunlight are minute particles.

573
01:07:30,148 --> 01:07:34,188
Is it so far from your imagination they cannot do as I have suggested?

574
01:07:34,188 --> 01:07:37,521
Why a particle of sunlight can't even be seen or measured.

575
01:07:37,521 --> 01:07:41,562
Can you see or measure an atom? Yet you can explode one.

576
01:07:42,572 --> 01:07:45,501
A ray of sunlight is made up many atoms.

577
01:07:45,501 --> 01:07:49,541
So what if we do develop this solaronite bomb? We'd be even a stronger nation than now.

578
01:07:50,047 --> 01:07:56,107
Stronger. You see? You see? Your stupid minds...stupid! Stupid!

579
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:58,329
-That's all I'm taking from you!
-Get back here you jerk!

580
01:08:00,147 --> 01:08:01,158
Let him finish.

581
01:08:09,238 --> 01:08:12,572
It's because of men like you that all must be destroyed.

582
01:08:12,572 --> 01:08:17,622
Headstrong, violent! No use of the mind God gave you.

583
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:21,157
You talk of God ?

584
01:08:21,157 --> 01:08:25,198
You also think it impossible that we, too, might think of God?

585
01:08:28,228 --> 01:08:35,299
You,  who wear the uniform of your country. You see, I wear the uniform of my country.

586
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:42,470
Yes, we've had to use drastic means to get to you, but you left us no alternative.

587
01:08:43,076 --> 01:08:50,147
When you have the solaronite, you have nothing. Nor, does the universe.

588
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:55,500
You speak of solaronite, but just what is it?

589
01:08:56,409 --> 01:09:02,470
Take a can of your gasoline. Say this can of gasoline is the Sun.

590
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:08,733
Now you spread a thin a line of it to a ball, representing the Earth.

591
01:09:10,753 --> 01:09:14,793
Now, the gasoline represents the sunlight, the Sun particles.

592
01:09:15,904 --> 01:09:19,944
Here we saturate the ball with the gasoline, the sunlight.

593
01:09:21,258 --> 01:09:25,298
Then we put a flame to the ball. The flame will speedily travel around the Earth,

594
01:09:26,207 --> 01:09:28,934
back along the line of gasoline to the can,

595
01:09:28,934 --> 01:09:37,015
or the sun itself. It will explode this source, and spread to every place that gasoline, our sunlight, touches.

596
01:09:40,045 --> 01:09:44,086
Explode the sunlight here, Gentlemen, you explode the universe.

597
01:09:45,803 --> 01:09:51,863
Explode the sunlight here, and a chain reaction will occur, direct to the Sun itself.

598
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:56,207
And to all the planets that sunlight touches.

599
01:09:56,207 --> 01:10:01,257
To every planet in the universe. This is why you must be stopped.

600
01:10:02,671 --> 01:10:06,712
This is why any means must be used to stop you.

601
01:10:07,015 --> 01:10:12,065
In a friendly manner, or as it seems, you want it.

602
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:18,227
-He's mad.
-Mad? Is it mad that you destroy other people to save yourselves?

603
01:10:19,035 --> 01:10:20,651
You have done this.

604
01:10:20,651 --> 01:10:24,691
Is it mad that one country must destroy another to save themselves?

605
01:10:24,691 --> 01:10:28,732
You have also done this. How then is it mad that one planet

606
01:10:29,035 --> 01:10:33,075
must destroy another that threatens the very existence-
-That's enough!

607
01:10:35,499 --> 01:10:39,540
In my land, women are for advancing the race, not for fighting

608
01:10:39,843 --> 01:10:44,893
man's battles. Life is not so expansive on my planet.

609
01:10:45,196 --> 01:10:50,752
We don't cling to it like you do. Our entire aim is for the development of our planet.

610
01:11:10,347 --> 01:11:12,569
-What happened to you?
-How come you're all alone?

611
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:16,610
I asked for lots of help!
-You sounded drunk or something on the radio.

612
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:19,640
-If I didn't see it with my own eyes I would never have believed it!
-Believed what?

613
01:11:20,751 --> 01:11:23,175
It was horrible ! And he almost broke my shoulder!

614
01:11:23,175 --> 01:11:28,226
Look, what are you trying to say? If you don't make sense we'll never get to the bottom of this. Now who slugged you?

615
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:30,751
Inspector Clay.

616
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:34,791
-What?
-It was Clay all right, only not like we remembered him.

617
01:11:36,105 --> 01:11:38,933
Well his grave was busted into, wasn't it?

618
01:11:38,933 --> 01:11:41,155
Next you'll tell me you saw skeletons.

619
01:11:41,155 --> 01:11:45,195
-We did, earlier.
-Now I know you're off your rocker.

620
01:11:45,397 --> 01:11:48,731
All of us saw it, the Lieutenant, the Colonel, everybody!

621
01:11:48,731 --> 01:11:51,559
-Where's the Lieutenant now?
-We've gotta find 'em.

622
01:11:51,559 --> 01:11:57,215
Mrs. Trent is gone! I was left here to guard her. Then Clay showed up and put me out of the running.

623
01:11:57,316 --> 01:12:00,246
And the second time tonight and I'm getting darned tired of it!

624
01:12:00,246 --> 01:12:02,670
-Which way were they going?
-Oh, that way.

625
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:03,680
Come on!

626
01:12:11,054 --> 01:12:15,902
Then one day it could all be gone, in one big puff of smoke

627
01:12:16,104 --> 01:12:20,144
and ball of fire. All that out there,

628
01:12:20,953 --> 01:12:24,488
the stars, the planets,

629
01:12:24,488 --> 01:12:27,619
all just an empty void.

630
01:12:27,619 --> 01:12:30,346
You two had better come along with us.

631
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:34,387
-Come with you? Where?
-The police station.

632
01:12:36,912 --> 01:12:40,952
(laughs) So it seems you think you have the upper hand.

633
01:12:41,255 --> 01:12:42,265
Look out there.

634
01:12:48,427 --> 01:12:49,437
Jeff.

635
01:13:00,245 --> 01:13:04,285
She is unharmed, but he would kill in seconds if I so choose.

636
01:13:14,386 --> 01:13:15,396
Holy cow!

637
01:13:23,578 --> 01:13:24,588
Look there.

638
01:13:29,033 --> 01:13:33,073
It's Clay all right, there's no mistaking that.
-And he's got Mrs. Trent!

639
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:37,820
-Get your gun ready.
-From all I've seen tonight guns won't do any good.

640
01:13:37,921 --> 01:13:42,265
Clay is dead, and we buried him. How are we going to kill somebody that's already dead ?

641
01:13:42,972 --> 01:13:48,022
Dead! And yet there he stands! That other one earlier I emptied a full clip into him.

642
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:52,164
I'm seeing it, that's the only reason I'm listening to you.

643
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:59,537
Look, I've got an idea. Hurt him or not, we've got to try something.

644
01:13:59,638 --> 01:14:03,982
I'm gonna sneak up behind him and whop him over the head. That oughta make him move.

645
01:14:04,285 --> 01:14:08,426
Follow me. Even when Clay was alive he couldn't run fast enough to catch me,

646
01:14:08,628 --> 01:14:12,769
so when he does, you grab Mrs. Trent and run like lightning in the opposite direction.

647
01:14:13,274 --> 01:14:16,305
-Oh, you think it will work?
-Know anything else to try?

648
01:14:33,577 --> 01:14:38,628
Oh, I'll be all right. Take care of the others.

649
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:43,779
Your men have felled the big one.

650
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:47,517
This could only happen because the electrode ray is off.

651
01:14:47,517 --> 01:14:49,537
He'll walk again when I turn it on.

652
01:14:49,537 --> 01:14:51,254
Hold it, right there.

653
01:14:51,254 --> 01:14:56,304
-Suppose the Lieutenant and the others are in that thing!
-Well suppose there are Martians or something in there!

654
01:15:05,799 --> 01:15:06,809
Come on, let's go.

655
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,456
Open up in there, open up!

656
01:15:16,506 --> 01:15:19,435
-Get that door open.
-Colonel I wouldn't know one switch from another.

657
01:15:35,799 --> 01:15:37,819
Hold on Eros, I'll have the ship in the air in a minute!

658
01:16:00,445 --> 01:16:02,970
Get out of here, Jeff! The ship's on fire!

659
01:16:23,374 --> 01:16:25,495
Eros!

660
01:16:25,495 --> 01:16:29,536
Eros everything's on fire! Hurry, wake up Eros! Eros, Eros, wake up, wake up!

661
01:16:36,707 --> 01:16:40,748
Eros! Eros wake up, Eros! God wake up!

662
01:16:59,232 --> 01:17:02,363
Oh, I wonder if that's the last we'll see of them?

663
01:17:02,363 --> 01:17:05,293
Perhaps, but sooner or later there'll be others.

664
01:17:05,293 --> 01:17:09,333
Look!

665
01:17:11,454 --> 01:17:15,192
Have they caught that woman, that thing yet?

666
01:17:15,192 --> 01:17:17,717
Hey that's right, there's another ghoul running loose.

667
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:20,141
And it's my guess that she'll look like him.

668
01:17:20,141 --> 01:17:24,181
With the ship and the ray gun gone, they have no control.

669
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:29,131
We got to hand it to them though, they're far ahead of us.

670
01:17:33,777 --> 01:17:37,818
Fire! Eros! (screams)

671
01:17:45,898 --> 01:17:49,939
My friend, you have seen this incident based on sworn testimony.

672
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:54,080
Can you prove that it didn't happen?

673
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:58,120
Perhaps on your way home, someone will pass you in the dark,

674
01:17:58,322 --> 01:18:02,363
and you will never know it, for they will be from outer space.

675
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:08,120
Many scientists believe that another world is watching us this moment.

676
01:18:08,827 --> 01:18:11,757
We once laughed at the horseless carriage,

677
01:18:11,757 --> 01:18:15,797
the aeroplane, the telephone, the electric light, vitamins,

678
01:18:16,807 --> 01:18:19,534
radio, and even television!

679
01:18:19,534 --> 01:18:23,575
And now some of us laugh at outer space.

680
01:18:27,514 --> 01:18:31,554
God help us... in the future.
